TI-99/22 build support files

This repo contains the files I have modified to support the TI-99/22 system build as completed on the Earie's 8-bit Workshop Youtube channel. https://github.com/danwerner21/TI99_22

If you have any feedback please do leave it in the youtube comments for the appropriate video. I'll add the links here as they are generated.

Thanks for visiting.

Update 10th August 2025

I have edited the OpenScad file that creates the 3d print STL files for the TI-99/22 case. Although I have a large 3d printer, its not big enough to print the enclosure in one hit. So I have added a 'side' option that allows you to create the top left and right, and the bottom left and right as separate 3d renderings. One side also contains tabs that glue to the other. Completed STL files are also in the repo.
